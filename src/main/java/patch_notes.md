# [ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è] Hero Changes

Vortex
---

*The general gameplay of Vortex stays the same, but there are changes to Astral Stars.*

### Astral Star

* Is now **first** talent.
* To summon a star, it now costs **Max Health**.
* **The stars can now be destroyed.**
    * If the star is destroyed, the sacrificed health will **not** be returned!

There is a difference between **health** and **max health**.

Summoning stars spends **max health**, meaning you cannot regenerate past it.

*This change adds health management aspect.*

### Astral Vision

* Renamed "Star Aligner" >> "Astral Vision".
* Is now an Input Talent:


* **LEFT CLICKING** implodes the target star after a short delay, dealing AoE damage.
    * The damage is based on that star's current health.
    * **The sacrificed health will not be returned!**

*This change forces player to only use this ability in dire need.*

* **RIGHT CLICKING** links the player with the target star, teleporting you to it.
    * Teleport is not instant anymore.
    * Upon finishing teleport, collect the **star**, regain sacrificed health and regenerate health based on that
      star's remaining health.
    * The link damage can no longer crit.

### Like a Dream (Passive)

* The damage boost from the passive now applies to *any* **astral** damage.

### Arcana (Ultimate)

* Launch an Astral Energy in front of you that follows your crosshair.
* The energy deals rapid damage and knocks enemies back.

Any Vortex ability damage is considered **astral** damage, meaning it is boosted by the passive!

Juju
---

### Climb (Passive)

* Optimize climbing.
* Juju can now jump of the wall in the opposite direction.
* Reduce cooldown 10s >> 6s.
