### System Rework Notes: ###

- Spawned mobs should *always* have a game entity
associated with them; if spawned naturally, create
default game entity.

- Clone hero attribute to modify them.

- "entity instanceof Player" is gonna throw a lot of errors...

- Rejoining seems to be broken (ult does not recharge)
